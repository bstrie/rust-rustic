 Mr. Goodkat: The reason I'm in town, in case you're wondering, is because of a
              Kansas City Shuffle.
        Nick: What's a Kansas City Shuffle?
 Mr. Goodkat: A Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right, you go left.
        Nick: Never heard of it.
 Mr. Goodkat: It's not something people hear about. Falls on deaf ears mostly.
              This particular one has been over twenty years in the making.
        Nick: Twenty years, huh?
 Mr. Goodkat: No small matter. Requires a lot of planning. Involves a lot of
              people. People connected only by the slightest of events. Like
              whispers in the night, in that place that never forgets, even
              when those people do.
 Mr. Goodkat: It starts with a horse.");
